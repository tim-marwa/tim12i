- 👋 Hi, I’m Tim
- 👀 I’m interested in Java, JavaScript, Selenium
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure, AWS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me: 

<!---
=====================Test Approach================
-Tools to be used are simple to understand, opensource and well maintained
-Cypress can be run on many OS types using the same js file[Linux, Windows, macOS]. A user could be accessing the web page from any location with any browser.
=====================Tools========================
Automation: Cypress (https://download.cypress.io/desktop/6.8.0)
VPN: HotspotShieledBasic (https://www.hotspotshield.com/)
IDE: Visual Studio Code (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) 
Browser: Chrome v95.0.4638.69
=====================Install Steps================
-Disable all antivirus plugins in the chrome browser. AdBlock must be disabled as well. This may interfere with the run
-Place clearscore.spec.js file in c:\temp\clearscore.spec.js

===================== Test Running steps================
-[Optional] If running this JS code from South Africa or any other location that results in a 
redirect when you visit the clearscore homage, install a free VPN. See screenshots folder for an example.
-Extract the cypress zip fil from the step above nd extract it to C:\Cypress
-Open a new command line in administrator mode and CD to location of the cypress exe [C:\cypress]
-Run the following command: cypress run --spec c:\temp\clearscore.spec.js --browser chrome
1. How would you integrate the tests you have written into a continuous integration environment?
2. How would you approach running the same tests across mobile devices and different browsers?
-Cypress can run tests across multiple browsers. Supported browsers are Chrome and Microsoft Edge, and Firefox.
For Example:
--cypress run run --spec ./clearscore.spec.js --browser firefox
--cypress run --spec c:\temp\clearscore.spec.js --browser chrome
3. If you had more time available, are there any improvements that you would make to the code provided?
-The code is perfectas it is :). However, I would improve general test coverage by running continues integration on all OS's supported by cypress for regression [Linux, Windows, macOS]

======================issues=======================
-These Cyprus tests were run form South Africa. Every time I attempt access https://www.clearscore.com this would immediately redirect to 
https://www.clearscore.com/za/. This final page has no popup for cookies at all ☹
